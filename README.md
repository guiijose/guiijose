# Hi, I'm Guilherme JosÃ© ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Computer Science and Engineering** student at **Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico** in Lisbon, originally from **PortimÃ£o**. Iâ€™m passionate about technology and problem-solving. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the world of **machine learning**, **data science** and its applications in the world of **quantitative finance**, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and collaborate with others.

## ðŸš€ Technologies & Skills

- **Languages**: Java, Python, C, C++
- **Machine Learning**: Sklearn, TensorFlow, Sklearn
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Django
- **Areas of Focus**: Machine Learning, AI, Finance

## ðŸ”§ Projects & Contributions

I love working on **personal projects** where I can experiment with new ideas and technologies. Some of my notable work includes:
- **Explcamisto**: Contributed to a project aimed at providing tutoring for financially disadvantaged teenagers in secondary schools across Portugal. As a member of the IT team, I played a key role in developing the web platform using **Django**.  
- **Go Game**: A school project developed by me, this is a Python implementation of the **Go** board game, simulating gameplay, rules, and strategies. The project supports local two-player games with scoring and a terminal-based interface.  
- **IST-KVS2**: I developed this project in collaboration with my peer [KikoMV](https://github.com/KikoMV) for an Operating Systems course. It is a client-server API that uses named pipes for communication. The server is a multithreaded application that handles read, write, edit, and delete operations on a hash table, as well as client subscriptions to specific keys. The client program registers clients with the server, manages subscribe and unsubscribe requests, and processes notifications from the server.  
- **K-Means Clustering Engine**: Collaborated with [KikoMV](https://github.com/KikoMV) and [Xano-verse](https://github.com/Xano-verse/) for an Introcuction to Computer Architecture project using **K-Means clustering**. We implemented the **K-means** algorithm using low level programming - RISC-V Assembly. We used our understandment of CPU architecture, instruction execution and memory hierarchy in order to optmize the algorithm.
- **Fiftyville Mystery Solution**: This is a personal project developed by me. Fiftyville that belongs to the CS50 2023 week 8 problem set. I used **SQL** queries over a relational database in order to find who stole the CS50 rubber duck.

Feel free to browse my repositories to see the work I've done and the projects I'm currently tackling.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Seeking

I am actively looking for a **summer internship in 2025** where I can apply my skills in **machine learning** to contribute to impactful, real-world projects. While my primary focus is on **machine learning**, I am also open to exploring opportunities in other **technology-related fields**. 

If you know of any opportunities or are interested in collaborating, feel free to connect with me. Letâ€™s create something amazing together!
